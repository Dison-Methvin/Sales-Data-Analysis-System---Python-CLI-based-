## Introduction
Data Labs is a leading software development company in Sri Lanka, focusing on helping businesses build their operations through creative and effective solutions. As an apprentice software developer at Data Labs, you have been tasked with developing a command-line interface-based software system using Python for the following scenario.

## Project Description
Sampath Food City (PVT) Ltd is one of the main supermarket networks in Sri Lanka with several branches island-wide. Currently, each branch records transactions through a point of sale (POS) system, and at the end of each month, the recorded data is transferred to a centralized database. The top-level management uses this centralized data to perform monthly sales data analysis to make managerial decisions.

The existing paper-based manual system for monthly sales data analysis has several drawbacks, including human errors, time consumption, data redundancy, inconsistency, and difficulty in finding insights, which negatively affect business performance. Therefore, the management has decided to implement a customized software system for sales data analysis to eliminate these weaknesses.

## Features
The new sales data analysis system provides the following features:
- Monthly sales analysis of each branch.
- Price analysis of each product.
- Weekly sales analysis of the supermarket network.
- Product preference analysis.
- Analysis of the distribution of the total sales amount of purchases.

## Usage
To use the sales data analysis system, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the main script using the command: `python main.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various analyses.

## Conclusion
This system aims to streamline the sales data analysis process for Sampath Food City, reducing errors and improving efficiency. By leveraging this software, the management can make more informed decisions based on accurate and timely data insights.
